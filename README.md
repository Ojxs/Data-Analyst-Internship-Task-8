# Task 8: Simple Sales Dashboard Design

## Overview

This repository documents the solution for a data visualization task focused on building a basic, interactive sales performance dashboard. The project demonstrates proficiency in using a BI tool (Power BI/Tableau) to transform raw data into actionable visual insights.
